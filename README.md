# instagram-clone-basic-css-JS

This is a basic "instagram-like" clone that uses basic HTML, CSS and javascript for a static page. 
My page is dedicated to sad SEC sports fans and can be viewed [here](http://sadsecfans.surge.sh/).
You can page through the images using the on screen arrow keys or using your right arrow and left arrow keyboard buttons.
There is a modal overlay that is activated when clicking on the main image and it can be closed out with escape or the X-button on screen.
